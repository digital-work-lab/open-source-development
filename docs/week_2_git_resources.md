# Git Resources

## Glossary

- **Version Control**: A system to manage changes to source code over time, allowing collaboration and tracking of revisions.
- **Commit**:  Snapshot of changes made to files in a repository, saved with a unique identifier, allowing you to track and manage the history of your project.
- **Branch**: Movable pointer to a specific commit, allowing you to work on separate lines of development without affecting the main project history.
- **Merge**: Process of combining changes from one branch into another, integrating their commit histories into a unified sequence.
- **Merge Conflict**: Issues that occur when changes from different branches conflict with one another during merging.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch into another, often used for code review in open-source workflows.
- **Git Reset vs. Revert**: Techniques for undoing commits, either by removing them or by creating a new commit to reverse changes.
- **Atomic Commits**: Small, focused commits that group related changes together to improve clarity and history tracking.
- **Remote/origin**: `origin` is the default name Git gives to the remote repository when it's cloned. It typically refers to the source repository from which your local repository is cloned.
- **Upstream**: `upstream` refers to the primary repository from which a fork is created. It is the main project that your local or forked repository is tracking.
- **Fork**: A `fork` is a copy of a repository that is created under a different user's account. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original repository.
