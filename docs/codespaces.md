## GitHub account <a id="account"></a>

For the tutorials and the project, you will need a GitHub account (you may also consider appyling for [GitHub's Student Developer Pack](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student))

## Start a Codespace <a id="delete"></a>

There are several ways to start a Codespace.

One is through a direct link like this one (the repository is already pre-selected in the URL):

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=digital-work-lab/practice-git)

Another is to start the Codespace directly from the repository:

## Stop a Codespace <a id="delete"></a>

You can **stop** a Codespace to stop consuming computational resources but **keep the data** via the [Codespaces overview](https://github.com/codespaces):

## Delete a Codespace <a id="delete"></a>

You can **delete** a Codespace to stop consuming computational resources and **remove all data** via the [Codespaces overview](https://github.com/codespaces):
