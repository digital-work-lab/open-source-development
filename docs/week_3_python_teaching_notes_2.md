> - Have students start the codespaces on Github from colrev/tutorial branch (see notebook)
> - Ask students how they interpret the error messages, articulate the problem, how they would solve the problem, where/how they would search (do not provide solutions)
> - Run the pre-commit hooks a few times to illustrate the typing information

## Object-oriented programming <a id="object"></a>

- Encourage students to program using objects (instead of procedurally)
- Notice: when creating the `run()` method, the jif_labeler_instance switches to "self".

## Using CoLRev infrastructure <a id="colrev"></a>

- Go to API reference
- Navigate through the classes / dataset

## Save and commit  <a id="save-commit"></a>

- Ask students to analyze the changes that were actually committed
- Remind students that this is something they should have seen in the CoLRev tutorial.

## Merging Exercise (moved to later time point)

**Until the 10th of November**

- explain to the students what the merging exercise is about 
- tell them about the survey and that it is important to fill it out for the best practice session
- maybe create even a slide for the to look it up again

## Wrap-up <a id="wrap-up"></a>

**Next: Best practice and hacking sessions (per group)**

- Suggest pair-programming
- Which CoLRev-objects or libraries will be needed, which steps are required
- Create a fork for the team, give access to team members, and add a note to the issue feed
- Check the resources provided with the issue, discuss the project, and make plans

## Resources
