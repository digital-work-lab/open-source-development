In this session, we learn essential Git and coding best practices.
This will help your ability to write clean, maintainable code and use Git effectively for version control.
The session also includes practical examples and guidelines that will help you develop better workflows for collaborative coding projects.

> **Checklist**
>
> - Do we have a directory for the project data that is separate from the `colrev` directory?
> - What is our plan to split work across branches?
> - Do the pre-commit hooks pass?
> - Can the working branches be merged? Should they be synchronized?
