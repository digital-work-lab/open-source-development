## What Our Students Say

We are delighted to share the feedback from students who have participated in our open source project in previous semesters. Their experiences and insights help us continually improve and ensure a valuable learning journey for all.

- "Thank you very much for the project! It was really great to get to know the CoLRev project and to learn a lot about working with Git and programming in Python. I would definitely recommend the project. As for suggestions for improvement, I agree that working with the virtual machine was sometimes challenging. On the other hand, it was also interesting to get to know it."
- "A great project where you could learn a lot if you wanted to."
-  "All in all, a very successful project, with a few possible points for improvement, but one that gives a first insight into working on larger projects and working on larger projects and challenges and encourages the students to the right extent."
- "I really liked the hacking sessions, where we always got very good feedback on the right scale and were also encouraged to think about things with questions from Prof. Wagner. We were also encouraged to think with questions from Prof. Wagner."
- "I liked the fact that we were able to work very freely and independently on our problem as a group, but that we were always able to make appointments with Prof. Wagner at very short notice if we had problems or questions.
- "We were always able to make appointments with Prof. Wagner at very short notice. This gave me the impression that we were working we were working WITH the lecturer on the problem and finding the best solution rather than blindly choosing the first solution that came along. In my opinion, working independently on a complex problem is the most important skill that I improved with the help of the project."
- "The support I received throughout the project was particularly good, as was the opportunity to deal with topics that were not previously available at the university, but which can be extremely important for your professional life."

## How Our Students Continue to Be Involved

Some have decided to build on the project and write their thesis in the context of CoLRev (see [overview](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/theses/docs/completed.html){: target="_blank"}), including Albert Borchardt, Katharina Maria Ernst, Luca Ossendorf, and Robert Theis.
