# Information on this session:

- Form groups of three to four participants to collaborate on the tasks, solve them together, and engage in meaningful discussions about your solutions.
- Over the course of two sessions, we will focus on refining a single module using the colrev run command, progressively enhancing it with each iteration.

---

# Start our development environment on GitHub Codespaces

Resume the [Codespace started in the previous session](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev)

# Package setup

To create a new Python package, you can use package and dependency management tools, such as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and `poetry init`.

If you work on existing CoLRev packages, you can extend the existing code available in the [internal packages directory](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/tree/main/colrev/packages).

To create a new CoLRev package, navigate to the [internal packages directory](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/tree/main/colrev/packages) and run

```
colrev package --init
```

This command assists you in setting up a new CoLRev package interactively.

More information on package development is available [here](../docs/week_3_python_packages) and in the [documentation](https://colrev-environment.github.io/colrev/dev_docs/packages.html).

# Next: Best practice and hacking sessions (per group)

- Study the [overview of Python and CoLRev packages](../docs/week_3_python_packages)
- Read the CoLRev-Enhancement Proposal on SearchSources [CEP-002](https://colrev-environment.github.io/colrev/foundations/cep/cep003_search_sources.html), and raise questions in the issue feed (if any)
- Take notes on key challenges and questions (for the best practice session)
- Schedule consultation sessions as needed via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min?month=2023-10)

Useful links and resources for learning Python are available [here](../docs/resources).

# Deliverables

Contribute code to a fork, create branches and merge code (see [deadline](index.html#deliverables)).

- The merge should be done in one of the first hacking session meetings
- Students should prepare the merge by selecting suitable branches and explaining why they should be merged
- We will complete the merge together with the students to prevent and solve problems
