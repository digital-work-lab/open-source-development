# What you will learn (I): Git/GitHub

- Use git and GitHub for versioning and collaboration
- Git quickly established itself as the most popular version control system
- As a prominent example, Microsoft has acquired GitHub and moved the source code of Windows to git ([1](https://www.golem.de/news/gvfs-windows-team-nutzt-fast-vollstaendig-git-1705-128039.html))
- Many companies have public GitHub programs and share parts of their work as Open-Source (e.g., [Google](https://github.com/google) or [Meta](https://github.com/facebook)) 

![bg right:40% width:350px](../assets/git-diffusion.png)

<!-- 
Ask students why Google, AirBnB etc. would publish code?
-> Open Source works better
-> Identify and attract talent (they may be very picky)
-->

---

# What you will learn (II): Python

- Write Python code and contribute to a Python package
- Python is the leading programming language in several rankings, including the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and the [PYPL (PopularitY of Programming Language)](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) ranking
- Job requirements for **Data Scientists**, **Full-stack Software Engineers**, **DevOps Engineers**, or **Data Engineers** commonly include Python ([1](https://de.indeed.com/jobs?q=Python))

# What you will learn (III): Open-Sourcing

- Work with the Open-Source workflows of GitHub
- Make a first contribution to a public Open-Source project
- Adopt the role of a maintainer and review code of your peers
- Have an opportunity to create your *developer portfolio*

# The project: CoLRev

Collaborative Literature Reviews (CoLRev) is an open-source environment for collaborative literature reviews. It integrates with different synthesis tools, takes care of the data, and facilitates Git-based collaboration.

The following features stand out:

- Supports all literature review steps: problem formulation, search, dedupe, (pre)screen, pdf retrieval and preparation, and synthesis
- An open platform based on shared data and process standards
- Builds on git and its transparent collaboration model for the entire literature review process
- Focus: command-line interface

![bg right:30% width:300px](../assets/colrev-logo.png)

<!-- 
Ambition: Open-source environment for literature reviews (like R for statistics, or Python for ML)

Wer hat schon mal eine Literaturübersicht geschrieben?

Command line!

git as an inspiration: rapid adoption (not because there were shiny interfaces, but because the data management was very efficient, reliable, and scalable to large teams)

![width:750px center](../assets/agenda.png)
<!-- Note: agenda.pptx in git-collaboration repository -->

Dates and rooms are available [online](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/). We will evaluate the code four days before the code review session.

<!--
Klar kommunizieren: wenn ihr die Programmiererfahrung/Kurse nicht mitbringt und euch das nicht zutraut, dann belegt das Projekt eher im nächsten Semester.

Highlight: your contribution will be public/used by others!

Ggf. auf Projekt im nächsten Semester verweisen

Clear message:
- You have to learn git and python. I will provide an introductory session, but you will need to invest more time.
- you are expected to set up your environment. I am available to answer questions, but I cannot setup individual machines.

contribution: you are expected to make that contribution (know what you do, be able to explain it - you cannot use generative AI like ChatGPT because you will have to submit the code under the MIT license.)

small teams, everyone is expected to program and contribute - with git, we see contributions. - that's a good thing if you tend to pull your weight

-->

# How groups will form

You **assign yourself to a group** when you contribute code following these steps:
1. **Signal your intent** to contribute by joining the issue discussion on Github (in the [issue discussion](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/milestone/8), before the **Git Session**, for two topics at most).
2. **Organize your work**, meet potential group members, and select a project leader (in the following sessions). Keep in mind that **no more than 6 people** will be accepted per group.
3. **Officially sign up for a group** by contributing a non-trivial code part. Contributions of team members must be in separate commits. Select a project lead who sends your Github-ID together with a link to your code contribution, your student ID, and e-mail address to [gerit.wagner@uni-bamberg.de](mailto:gerit.wagner@uni-bamberg.de).
<!-- Your participation will be confirmed and your account will be linked to the project issue. -->

This process ensures that **all group members make a fair contribution**. It is at our discretion to adapt the rules if necessary. It is your responsibility to bring up concerns early.

<!-- 
Sie haben es selbst in der Hand - Sie können sich bei dem Thema einbringen, das Sie interessiert!

the next sessions will also serve as a group forming session



projekt: gruppenfindung:

- Generell ansagen: ich mache keine Gruppen am Anfang. Man zeigt, dass man an einem Teiltehma mitarbeitet wernn man zu einem Pull-request beiträgt. Man kann anderen signalisieren, wenn man an einem Thema interessiert ist, indem man einem issue folgt. Man kann also auch strategisch issues wählen, denen keiner folgt. Es ist wichtig, früh zu pushen. Es ist möglich (und empfman ohlen) aber nicht zwingend notwendig, sich in Teams zu treffen.
-> Regel: wenn man auf einen issue pushed muss man sich ausreichend vorher eingetragen haben, im issue kommunizieren.
- Ich behalte mir vor, bis zur Python session (willkürlich bzw. in Abstimmung) Gruppen zu verkleinern (bestimmte TeilnehmerInnen zu verpflichten, in andere Themen zu wechseln).
- Eigene Verantwortung: Gruppen mit mehr als 5 Teilnehmenden sollten vermieden werden, müssten substantiell höhere Erwartungen erfüllen. Jeder TeilnehmerIn ist verpflichtet, mir zu signalisieren, wenn Gruppen zu groß werden.
-> Gruppen in den späteren Sessions bitten, sich zusammenzusetzen (austausch anstoßen)
-> Durchmischung kann durch "Überbuchen" von beliebten Issues getrieben werden (es wird zufällig/von mir ausgewählt, wer wechseln muss)
-> es bleibt in gewissem Umfang möglich, die Themenauswahl/Gruppenauswahl mit zu beeinflussen (zB. wenn man in kleinen Gruppen auf Themen mit wenig Interessenten geht)

-> Ich setze Anreize, dass Beiträge früh geleistet werden (keine Riesen-Commits kurz vor Schluss), und dass eine gute Abstimmung in der Gruppe erfolgt (Anforderungen), und dass die Gruppenverteilung ausgeglichen ist (nicht Open-Source konform, aber für das Projekt wichtig.)

-> Abstimmen mit den Füßen (Open-Source-like)

-> anders als DBs vorschlag (Durchmischung)

-> gut erklären, wie sich ein Open-Source Projekt organisiert (issues, transparente Kommunikation, ...)

DB: alle mitnehmen? LT: quote erforderlich? (WI/ISM)

ASK: how many ISM (Java not mandatory) and WI?
-> maybe require a certain number of ISM students per group?

<!-- # TODO : Organize (fork/branch), develop, PR and Feedback, code analysis deadline -->

# How you can make the project a success

- Embrace the challenge and adopt a problem solving mindset
- Take full responsibility to set up your programming environment
- Be prepared. Know your code, be able to explain it, and ask prepared questions (Google it, consider different options)
- Do not use generative AI such as ChatGPT (risk of copyright infringement)
- Adopt an Open-Source approach (work publicly, communicate in English, create a profile)
- Reach out and schedule individual hacking sessions via [calendly](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min) to discuss challenges and get feedback

# How this project may benefit you

- The value of Open Source Software (OSS) development experiences is increasingly recognized as a significant indicator of a candidate's capabilities in technology and software development.
- According to Long (2009, *Journal of Information Technology Education: Research*), OSS contributions are noteworthy on resumes and play a crucial role in hiring and promotion decisions.
- Employers view OSS experiences as strong evidence of a candidate's:
  - Practical skills
  - Problem-solving abilities
  - Collaborative spirit
- You can add this project to your CV!

<!--
- This project demonstrate:
  - A commitment to the craft beyond formal education
  - Real-world skills
  - The ability to contribute to and manage complex projects

"In the realm of technology and software development, the value of Open Source Software (OSS) development experiences has been increasingly recognized as a significant indicator of a candidate's capabilities. According to Long (2009) in the Journal of Information Technology Education: Research, OSS contributions are not only noteworthy on resumes but also play a crucial role in hiring and promotion decisions. Employers view these experiences as strong evidence of a candidate's practical skills, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative spirit.

Long's research highlights that OSS development experiences can substantially enhance a candidate's attractiveness to potential employers. This is because such experiences demonstrate a commitment to the craft beyond formal education, showcasing real-world skills and the ability to contribute to and manage complex projects. Employers often perceive these contributions as indicators of a candidate's initiative, technical proficiency, and familiarity with industry-standard practices.

Furthermore, OSS experiences are increasingly valued during promotions. Employees who have demonstrated their ability through OSS projects are seen as more capable and ready for advanced responsibilities. This recognition underscores the growing importance of OSS contributions in the professional landscape, affirming that these experiences can indeed make a significant difference in career advancement."

# Finding things in an Open Source project

Go to the [CoLRev project repository](https://github.com/CoLRev-Ecosystem/colrev).

Form groups of three and try to find the following information in 10 minutes:

1. How many commits, contributors, and downloads does the project have? What is the test coverage?
2. How does CoLRev compare to related tools? Which tool would you choose and why?
3. Where is the documentation and how can I install CoLRev?
4. What is the license and where can we find information on how to contribute to the project?
5. What information should be provided for bug reports, where can I open a feature request?
6. How many issues are open vs. closed? How many pull requests are open vs. closed?
7. How long do workflows with tests or code formatting run, when did the last one fail?
8. What is "unpaywall" used for in the project?
9. Where can we find the features planned for the next milestone?

<!-- 
"Schnitzeljagd" - auf Zeit
-> bei der Programmierung wichtig: Bibliotheken schnell einschätzen.

Nach 5 minuten fragen: wer ist schon fertig? ggf. mehr Zeit geben.
TODO : auflösen!

Correcponds to Software selection (criteria) -> ask: what does each concept mean?

unpaywall: search the github project or documentation (rst: documentation, py: get_pdf method)

go to new issue -> show template for bugs/new features

Afterwards: Ask who has found (1, 2, ...)
- show solutions
- Note: what should be improved?

Show the colrev/github website, documentation, explain the git/open-source community structure

Show architecture graph

Show the issues/the good-first-issue (and the code-markers)


-> the topics (features of 0.10.0): what we will look at later.

# CoLRev: Demo and Topics

An overview of the [process](https://colrev-environment.github.io/colrev/manual/operations.html) and the [workflow](https://colrev-environment.github.io/colrev/manual/workflow.html) are available in the documentation.
A brief overview is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfGGraQC6vs).
<!-- 
The topics cover:

- [API-based information retrieval](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/issues/120)

- [Data modeling and preparation](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/issues/129)

- [Data structures and schema validation](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/issues/107)

- [Data validation based on domain-specific rules](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/issues/109)

- [Analytics dashboards](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/issues/130)
 -->


<!-- 

Show that each issue has specific pointers to the code, mention that I am available to answer questions, provide feedback in the hacking sessions

Demonstrate workflow

- search: SearchSource: API-example: resembling Topic 1
- prep: This is where the journals (Topic 2) would provide input
- validation: show example -> validate also applies to review types (show problem formulation in the docs). (Topic 3)
- colrev stauts -> dashboard of the sample, burn-down chart (Topic 4)
- data: Data extraction (structured) -> validation, illustrate errors Topic 5

-->

**Find a topic**

- Go to the upcoming [milestone](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev/milestones) and read the open issues (available topics).
- Find others who are interested in the same topic.
- Ask questions.

<!--
Ask: who is interested in topic 1, ...?
-> connect people

Are there questions?

Note: good-first-issues: typical starting point when joining an open-source project

Explore the issues, try to understand them, identify those that you would be interested in
Then we can answer questions
TODO : also ask who would be interested in topic 1, 2, 3... (to give an overview of the topics that are highly popular)

TODO : emphasize parallels to git -->
